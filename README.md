- [BEM By Example](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/bem_by_example) - Learned a simpler way to write CSS.

- [BEM and SASS "The Cake and Icing"](https://dev.to/kachidk/bem-the-cake-and-sass-the-icing-58bb) - I have to look at this because I was using SCSS and not pure CSS, so I thought I should take a look at this.
